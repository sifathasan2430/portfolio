    I’m a passionate and self-driven web developer with a strong foundation in modern web technologies.
    I specialize in building responsive and user-friendly web applications using React.js, Tailwind CSS,
    Express.js, and MongoDB.
    <br /><br />
    Having recently completed a beginner-friendly full-stack project, I’ve gained hands-on experience
    in designing clean UI, integrating REST APIs, and managing backend data with MongoDB.
    I'm constantly learning and improving my skills to follow industry best practices.
    <br /><br />
    Currently, I’m looking for opportunities to contribute to real projects and collaborate with other developers.
